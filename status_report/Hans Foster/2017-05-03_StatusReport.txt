1)  We met Monday separately and then again on Tuesday during class, talked about everything.  I worked on a mock databaset to test our SQL lite queries and emailed
    the mid tier group the files. 

2)  I would like to add this database to the code and test it myself

3)  none so far, the editor looks good and things are on time
